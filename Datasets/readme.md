Within this notebook, we'll leverage a range of machine learning models to forecast the probability of customer churn. Among the models included are:
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost 
- SVM 

Diverse methods, such as adjusting class weights and applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), are employed to address the imbalanced nature of the dataset.



This notebook will also offer insights aimed at reducing the churn rate among customers.
