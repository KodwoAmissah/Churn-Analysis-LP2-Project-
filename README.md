A major hurdle they encounter is customer churn, which signifies the frequency at which customers abandon their services in favor of competitors. This phenomenon poses a substantial threat to a company's revenue and profitability, as acquiring new customers is frequently more expensive than retaining current ones.The dataset utilized for this project encompasses user demographic data, service consumption details, and billing information. Our objective is to perform an exploratory data analysis to uncover correlations, patterns, and trends associated with customer attrition.
